## Known issues

- Styling is incomplete
- When editing a date it updates both fields
- You need to manually reload the page to see the updates on the calendar

## TODO's / Enhancements
- Use an actual backend like Graphql or a Restful service
- Alternative to a custom backend add an intregration to gCal with auth
- Add search and filtering like I did [here](https://react-budget-app.netlify.app) [repo](https://github.com/benhalverson/react-budget-app)
- Add more tests
- Automate CI/CD process
- Use Docker
